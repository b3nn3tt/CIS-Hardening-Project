# CIS Hardening Project

## Objective:
To develop a suite of scripts and tools to automate the deployment of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) hardening guide controls across various operating systems.

## Background:
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides a set of best practices and guidelines to ensure the secure configuration of operating systems, software, and infrastructure. Manually implementing these guidelines can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially across diverse operating systems.

### Scope

#### Operating Systems Covered:

* Windows 11
* Linux (popular distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, and RedHat)
* MacOS

#### Key Features:

* Automation scripts for the deployment of CIS controls
* A user-friendly interface to select specific controls for deployment
* Comprehensive logging and reporting to track deployment status and any potential issues

#### Future Features (in time...):

* Rollback capability to revert changes if necessary
* Periodic audit tool to ensure continuous compliance with CIS guidelines

## Methodology

### Research & Analysis: 

* Begin by thoroughly understanding the CIS guidelines for each operating system

### Script Development: 

* Write scripts using scripting languages and frameworks suitable for each OS

### Testing:

* Test each script in a controlled environment to ensure it works as intended and does not introduce new vulnerabilities

### Deployment & User Training:

* Deploy the tools to the target environments and train users on their correct use

### Maintenance & Updates:

* Regularly update the scripts to align with the latest CIS guidelines and to cater to OS updates and patches

## Benefits

### Efficiency:

* Significantly reduces the time required to harden systems

### Consistency:

* Ensures that every system is configured according to the same standards

### Security:

* Reduces the risk of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities

### Compliance:

* Helps organizations maintain and demonstrate compliance with industry standards and regulations

## Conclusion

The CIS Hardening Automation Tools project aims to provide a streamlined and efficient way to ensure that various operating systems are securely configured according to CIS standards. By automating this process, organisations can ensure a consistent and robust security posture across their IT infrastructure.
