### Scope:

#### Operating Systems Covered:

* Windows 11
* Linux (popular distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, and RedHat)
* MacOS

#### Key Features:

* Automation scripts for the deployment of CIS controls
* A user-friendly interface to select specific controls for deployment
* Comprehensive logging and reporting to track deployment status and any potential issues

#### Future Features (in time...):

* Rollback capability to revert changes if necessary
* Periodic audit tool to ensure continuous compliance with CIS guidelines
